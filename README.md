# ⚡ FlClash + BDiX Bypass Config — Convert BDiX to Raw Speed 

This repository provides an **open-source configuration file** that, when used with the open-source FlClash / Clash client, helps broadband or Wi-Fi users route BDiX (Bangladesh Intranet Exchange) traffic directly — converting BDiX speed into true **raw speed**.  

- 🚀 Even if your regular internet is slow, using this bypass config can allow files on the internet to download at very high speed — up to **500 Mbps capacity** (depending on your ISP BDiX Capacity).  
- 💡 If your BDiX speed is higher, this bypass converts it to raw local throughput for maximum performance.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo contains only the configuration file. You must install FlClash (or Clash client) from the official open-source. For iOS devices, you can use Clash Meta (Clash Mi) from the App Store.
